Revision history for Perl extension Weather::Product.

1.0.6  Sat Jul 24 17:16:22 1999
        - original version

1.1.0  Wed Jul 28 16:53:58 1999
        - moved code for parsing NWS-formatted products into a
          separate module, Weather::Product::NWS

1.2.0  Mon Aug 2 03:07:25 1999
        - added purge method to remove "orphaned" products
        - orphans are removed after parsing products
        - the station in the WMO header is also added as a "product"
          (Technically products from different stations should be treated as
          different Weather::Product objects, but U.S. NWS products cover
          larger areas and may be broken down by stations)
        - added POD to module
        - included README with distribution

1.2.1  Tue Aug 10 05:55:05 1999
        - minor documentation tweaks
        - added max_age property and age method
        - products older than max_age (when max_age != 0) are purged
        - the time method will return null if the timestamp cannot be
          determined (usually from a previous month)
